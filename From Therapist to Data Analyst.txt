From Therapist to Data Analyst

I never imagined I would become a Data Analyst, writing code, solving analytical challenges, and genuinely enjoying the process of uncovering insights. My career began in music therapy, where I used evidence-based musical interventions to help clients reach individualized goals. I thrived in building relationships, understanding each client’s needs, and exploring how patterns in music could influence emotional, physical, and psychological outcomes.

That fascination with patterns and human behavior eventually became the bridge that led me into analytics. I pursued a Master’s in Business Analytics, where I built optimization models, analyzed financial scenarios, and created dashboards that made the story of data to life. These projects helped me connect statistical concepts to real-world business challenges and made me realize how similar my approach was to the way I worked as a music therapist.

Before beginning any music therapy treatment, I always started by listening and observing my clients’ abilities. I avoided assumptions and collected baseline information across different dimensions of well-being. Once I identified an individualized goal that was both approachable and meaningful, I implemented interventions tailored to their needs.

That same mindset guides my work in analytics. I begin by exploring the data without preconceived answers, understanding the baseline, and identifying what truly matters. From there, I develop insights and recommendations that support different areas of the business in making thoughtful, informed decisions.

In the end, whether through music or data, I have always cared about helping people reach their goals. Today, that means empowering organizations with insights that connect data, people, and purpose.
